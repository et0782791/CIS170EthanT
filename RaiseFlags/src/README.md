# Raise Flag

This program raises a flag using java fx.

## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

I took the listing from chapter 15 and added it to my project. I'm not quite sure if I was supposed to have 2 flags or not, but I do have
a flag that raises!

### Design

Design was easy. I just found a medieval flag and used that as my flag. Then I added a path transition and
assigned that to the flag.  


### Testing

First was finding the listing. I found that, then decided to see if i could use some of 
the code from the flashing text program we did in class. I couldn't figure it out in time so 
I had to make do with what I had. 

I tested a couple different ways of doing it, but decided on using the path transition 
because it was the easiest.
